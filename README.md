# Morse-Code-Converter-cpp
This program is written in C++ with Visual Studio 2015. This program will prompt the user to enter any sentence or passage, and then convert their text into morse code. The user can choose to read from a txt file to convert to morse code as well. The morse code converter is stored in a BST for the O(logn) search time complexity. Each node contains a character a-Z or 0-9. Periods and and commas are converted as well. The keyboard characters and their morse code representation are read in from a text file, and inserted into the BST.
